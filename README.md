Detection of Money Laundering on Blockchain Systems Using Artificial Intelligence
Money laundering, a crime that causes significant economic damage, has become more complex with technological developments. The rise of blockchain technology has led to increased anonymity in financial transactions, providing new avenues for illegal activities such as money laundering. This study used artificial intelligence to detect money laundering in the blockchain network. Using the Bitcoin Transaction Graph Elliptical dataset, our approach used only fraud-free labeled data to build an autoencoder model. This strategy enabled the effective detection of illegal transactions. The resulting model exhibited commendable performance metrics with accuracy of 0.89, F1 score of 0.94, F2 score of 0.96, and ROC AUC of 0.96. These results underscore the model’s robustness in uncovering and combating illicit financial activity in the blockchain ecosystem and reinforce the technology’s vital role in enhancing financial security.
